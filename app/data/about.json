    "bio": "Hey there! I'm Aniket — a 6th-semester B.Tech CSE student at SRM Institute of Science and Technology, fueled by curiosity and caffeine. I’m obsessed with creating intelligent, eye-catching digital experiences. From spinning up React dashboards with glassmorphism magic to building ML models for real-world predictions, I love blending tech and creativity. My tech journey started with HTML experiments, and now I’m deep into full-stack development, AI integrations, cloud workflows, and real-time data processing. I’ve built AI dashboards, data pipelines, and prediction systems, and I’m always hunting for the next hackathon, open-source sprint, or moonshot idea to dive into.",
